# Hot-reloader

Software development often involves running the same commands over and over. Boring!

`hot-reload` is a simple, standalone tool that watches a path and compiles your code and re-runs it everytime it detects a modification.

# Usage

```sh
hot-reload <path to watch> <build script> <target binary>
```
